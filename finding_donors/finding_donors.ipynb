    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classification), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve.

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "From what we have observed from the data, we can summarize the following overall characteristics below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The problem is a classification problem.\n",
    "2. There are only 2 category of target variables. (0 and 1).\n",
    "3. There 45222 samples in the original dataset while we will uses 36177 samples of them to train our models.\n",
    "4. There are 103 total features. 5 of them are numerical and the rest are dummy variables.\n",
    "5. No missing data and skew features are already normalise.\n",
    "6. Beacuse of a large number of features, we might not certain whether the data is linear or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Logistic Regression\n",
    "   - **Real-world application:** An example of logistic regression would be a classfication of whether which loaner should be lent money based on their characteristic such as educational level, income and family size.\n",
    "    Reference: [Logistic regression and its application in credit scoring](https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/27333/dissertation.pdf;jsessionid=40F3C4AE80CB3CF250039AF2DEA90AA9?sequence=1)\n",
    "   - **Strengths:** Logistic Regression is simple to implement and train. It can be trained with small amount of time even with a large dataset. And the result model is easy to understand eg. you can see the contribution of each factor by looking from its weight.\n",
    "   - **Weaknesses:** Due to its simplicity, it may not be able to fit complex model.\n",
    "   - **Why?** \n",
    "       - It is a classification problem.\n",
    "       - There are only 2 class of target variables.\n",
    "       - It is easy to understand and fast to train.\n",
    "       - This method should be the first model to try because of its simplicity and performance. And if the model is linear it will perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "   - **Real-world application:**\n",
    "   SVM can be used for classifying problem. One real world example uses SVM to predict whether a person has a disease or not using a set of propertis such as family history, age, race and ethnicity.\n",
    "   *Reference:* [Application of support vector machine modeling for prediction of common diseases: the case of diabetes and pre-diabetes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2850872/)\n",
    "   - **Strengths:** SVM is highly configurable and be able to train a very complex model. You can choose from a simple model like linear and polynomial at a certian degrees to radial basis function (RBF) kernel with certain gamma value.\n",
    "   - **Weaknesses:** Because of its power, you can easily train an overfit model. Also, SVC tooks a lot of time to train when the number of features are large.\n",
    "   *Reference:* [SVC Parameters When Using RBF Kernel](https://chrisalbon.com/machine_learning/support_vector_machines/svc_parameters_using_rbf_kernel/)\n",
    "   [SVM Time Complexity](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#complexity)\n",
    "   - **Why?:** \n",
    "       - It is a classification problem.\n",
    "       - There are only 2 class of target variables.\n",
    "       - SVM is a powerful classification method and it should be able to produce a higher accuracy model when logistic regression reachs it limit.\n",
    "       - We don't know if the data is linear or not. SVM can fit non linear data for us and we can see if SVM produces a better result than Logistic Regression\n",
    "   \n",
    "C. Ensemble Methods (AdaBoost)\n",
    "   - **Real-world application:** Ensemble Methods with AdaBoost can be used to train to detect where vehicles are a video. *Reference:* [Introducing New AdaBoost Features for Real-Time Vehicle Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.1293)\n",
    "   - **Strengths:** Ensemble Methods build a complex model from a lot of simpler models. These made it a good learning method that is both fast to train even for a large number of features. It also can produce complex model by using a lot of weaker models.\n",
    "   - **Weaknesses:** AdaBoost's goal is to find a single complex model from a lot of weaker models by combining regions of each weaker model to produce a overall region that have the least error. If the data is noisy or has outlier, it might cause some weaker models to have unreasonbly large influence over other models and cause the overall model incorrectly predict its output.\n",
    "   *Reference:* [Why is AdaBoost algorithm sensitive to noisy data and outliers? And how?](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-AdaBoost-algorithm-sensitive-to-noisy-data-and-outliers-And-how)\n",
    "   - **Why?:** \n",
    "       - It is a classification problem.\n",
    "       - It is faster than SVM to train and can produce more complex data than logistic regression.\n",
    "       - It can fit non linear data pretty well.\n",
    "       - It can fit data with a large number of feature quickly."

    "To understand how the \"AdaBoost\" method works, we need to first understand a concept of an \"ensemble method\". First, let's imagine that you owns a factory that need to make products. We need to hire some employees which we calls them a \"model\". A strong model is like an artisan who can craft a product by hand really neat, from the first to the last step, but he is very hard to train. On the other hand, a weak model is a factory work that you can hire plenty of them and you can easily train them to do a very specific task. Now, in the ensemble method way, you hire a number of worker and train them in a few weeks on each specific task in order to create a product that has the quality closes to a product crafted by an artisan who is trained with years of hardwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, our task is not to create something but to predict something. a employee or a model is a unit who make a prediction based on what its knows. The AdaBoost method chooses a type of model called \"Decision Tree\" that based its prediction on multiple yes and no question. How strong a model is is based on how many questions a model can asks, the more, the stronger. In this method, it creates a group of weak models. Each model makes a decision in their specialised area, for example, one model can predict an output very accurately if it knows that a car is made from factory A but for other factory he may rely on others. By gathering all of these weak models, AdaBoost can predict something really well and also in a small amount of training time."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
